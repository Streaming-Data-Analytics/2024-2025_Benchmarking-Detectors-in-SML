Optional project of the [Streaming Data Analytics](http://emanueledellavalle.org/teaching/streaming-data-analytics-2023-24/) course provided by [Politecnico di Milano](https://www11.ceda.polimi.it/schedaincarico/schedaincarico/controller/scheda_pubblica/SchedaPublic.do?&evn_default=evento&c_classe=811164&polij_device_category=DESKTOP&__pj0=0&__pj1=d563c55e73c3035baf5b0bab2dda086b).

## Background
Concept Drift occurs when the distribution of data changes over time, making a previously trained model less effective. In Streaming Machine Learning (SML) scenarios, it is critical to detect these changes early to adapt the model and maintain high performance.

CapyMOA implements several Concept Drift Detectors, tools that help identify concept drifts to allow models to adapt. The objective of this project is to conduct a benchmarking of different Concept Drift Detectors in CapyMOA, evaluating their impact on the performance of a baseline classifier.

## Goals and objectives
The project includes the following objectives:
- Test a Baseline Classifier without any drift detectors to measure its initial performance in terms of accuracy, execution time, and memory consumption.
- Compare the results obtained by applying different Concept Drift Detectors.
- Use 3-4 classic Streaming Machine Learning datasets to ensure a fair and meaningful comparison.
- Analyze how the integration of a Concept Drift Detector changes:
  -Accuracy/F1-score of the model.
  -Execution time required.
  -Memory and CPU utilization.
-Identify the most effective detector based on the conditions of each dataset.
